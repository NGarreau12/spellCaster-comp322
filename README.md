# Spell Caster

Mobile app RPG with the core mechanic being that enemies do not stop attacking and the player performs attacks by inputting specific button combinations, or casting spells. Created using JavaScript and HTML in Apache Cordova and Phaser 3.

This project serves as a demo of sorts to prove that this logic works. It will be utilized in a much larger project that will be started as my capstone project at Loyola University.
